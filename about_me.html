              <p>
                For the past 6 and a half years I've worked as a software tester and quality assurance manager. Unlike most people in this position, I do not have a background in computer science and instead worked my way up from the bottom. I've learned a lot on the job, but I'm become bored of quality assurance and my programming isn't where it needs to be in order to pursue developer positions. I felt that Epicodus would be a great opportunity to take a break from the industry and focus entirely on programming.

                In my free time I like to read, go to music festivals, binge on TV, play video games, and take care of my beautiful silver Persian cat named <a href="https://benjpac.github.io/rose_webpage/">Rose</a>.
